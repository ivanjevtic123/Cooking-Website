                            The modern lifestyle has also brought us a complete departure from creative activities that require dexterity. We have lost the ability to observe details and find satisfaction in everyday things and actions. This way of life distances us from ourselves and becomes conducive to the development of depression and anxiety. More and more psychotherapists are recommending manual activities as adjunctive therapy, preferably those that require a certain amount of creativity.

                            Cooking therapy is used today in a large number of mental health clinics. It is used to treat a number of disorders such as depression, anxiety, eating disorders, addiction diseases as well as disorders caused by the speed of the modern lifestyle. The importance of cooking therapy is all the greater if we keep in mind that the largest number of these disorders also gives excess weight within the clinical picture.

                            Consumption of foods such as celery and primrose, which contain the natural flavonoid apigenin, can prevent leukemia, concluded Dutch experts from the University of Groningen.

                            According to Maikel Pepelenbosch, one of the participants in the research, the tests showed that apigenin - a common ingredient in fruits and vegetables - is able to stop the development of two types of leukemia cells and reduce the chances of their survival, Reuters reported.
    
                            On the other hand, however, the Dutch team found that apigenin can reduce the positive effects of chemotherapy in people who have already been diagnosed with leukemia.
    
                            Flavolnoids are compounds with antioxidant properties, which protect cells from damage by oxygen molecules.
    
                            Some previous research has shown that apigenin, which is found in celery, primrose, red wine, tomato sauce and various other plant-based foods, can also be useful in preventing ovarian cancer.
